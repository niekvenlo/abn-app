# ABN RECIPE APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I installed two additional dependencies:

- `npm install @tanstack/react-query`, to manage server state;
- `npm install use-query-params`, to manage query string state in the url.

I did not use a CSS-in-JS library, although of course typically I would in practical apps.
